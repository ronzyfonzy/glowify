# Glowify

Glowify listens to changes that a user does on one (Listen) board and gives points to that user. Then it shows the score on the second (Publish) board in a form of a card. Each change gives the user additional points. Once the users achieves enough points he ascends to a higher level (Column).

## About

This project wasn't created just for the [GitKraken Glo Boards API Contest](https://www.gitkraken.com/glo-api-contest) but in majoriti out of curiosity to learn a bit more about [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express), [react](https://github.com/facebook/react/) and [sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize).

## Things that still need/can to be done

- Points editor: enable users to edit how many points is an event worth
- Security improvements (database and API)
- Achievements with tags. By reaching certain amount of a specific event you can unlock an achievement (commentator, mover, ...)
